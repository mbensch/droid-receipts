# Jira Tools

A plugin for **Factory (Droid)** and **Claude Code** for Jira issue creation and management via Atlassian MCP tools. Use `/jira-create` to create any issue type (Objectives, Initiatives, Epics, Stories, Bugs, and more) with guided intake and optional codebase analysis.

## Installation

### Factory (Droid)

```bash
droid plugin marketplace add https://github.com/mbensch/mb-ai-tools
droid plugin install jira-tools@mb-ai-tools
```

Or use the interactive UI: `/plugins` → Marketplaces → Add marketplace → enter URL

### Claude Code

```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/mbensch/mb-ai-tools
/plugin install jira-tools@mb-ai-tools
```

### From Local Directory (Development)

```bash
# Factory
droid plugin marketplace add /path/to/mb-ai-tools
droid plugin install jira-tools@mb-ai-tools

# Claude Code
/plugin marketplace add /path/to/mb-ai-tools
/plugin install jira-tools@mb-ai-tools
```

## Prerequisites

Requires the [Atlassian MCP integration](https://app.factory.ai/settings/integrations) to be configured in your agent's settings. The `acli` CLI is supported as a fallback for basic operations.

## Commands

### `/jira-create`

The primary entry point for creating any Jira issue type. The command:

1. Detects whether you are inside a git repository
2. Detects your Atlassian org and asks which project to work in; activates a project-specific skill when org and project match (e.g. `cars-project` for carscommerce/CARS)
3. Fetches available issue types from the selected project and asks which to create
4. Gathers your initial description
5. Asks whether to analyze the codebase (when in a git repo) to produce a more accurate ticket
6. Delegates to the appropriate `create-jira-*` skill, which handles clarifying questions, description formatting, ticket creation, and any project-specific post-creation steps

## Skills

### `manage-jira`

General-purpose Jira ticket management. Automatically used when you ask to:

- View, edit, or transition tickets
- Search with JQL
- Add comments
- Set custom fields (team, sprint, story points)
- Bulk operations

Includes a full acli command reference and troubleshooting guide.

### `create-jira-objective` *(internal)*

Structured Jira Objective creation. Invoked by `/jira-create`. Objectives are the highest level of the work hierarchy (Objective → Initiative → Epic → Story/Bug).

**Format:** Description (S.M.A.R.T), Key Results (1-3), Milestones / Phases (each maps to an Initiative).

### `create-jira-initiative` *(internal)*

Structured Jira Initiative creation. Invoked by `/jira-create`.

**Format:** Background, Objectives, Key Results / Success Metrics, Out of Scope (optional), Additional Information/Links.

### `create-jira-epic` *(internal)*

Structured Jira Epic creation. Invoked by `/jira-create`.

**Format:** Background, Goals, Acceptance Criteria, Out of Scope (optional), Additional Information/Links.

### `create-jira-story` *(internal)*

Structured Jira Story creation. Invoked by `/jira-create`.

**Format:** Background, Acceptance Criteria, Out of Scope (optional), Additional Information/Links.

### `create-jira-bug` *(internal)*

Structured Jira Bug creation. Invoked by `/jira-create`.

**Format:** Description, Steps to Reproduce, Additional Information/Links.

### `human-writing` *(internal)*

Applies human-writing guidelines to all ticket content drafted by `/jira-create`. Removes AI-sounding patterns (inflated significance, promotional language, em dash overuse, rule of three, AI vocabulary words) and ensures descriptions read like a person wrote them. Based on Wikipedia's "Signs of AI writing" guide.

Originally authored by [Factory-AI/factory-plugins](https://github.com/Factory-AI/factory-plugins/blob/master/plugins/droid-evolved/skills/human-writing/SKILL.md).

### `cars-project` *(internal)*

CARS project-specific configuration for the `carscommerce.atlassian.net` org. Activated automatically by `/jira-create` when the user is authenticated to carscommerce and selects the CARS project. Provides:

- Work hierarchy: Objective → Initiative → Epic → Story/Bug/Task → Sub-Task
- Custom field IDs: team (`customfield_11100`), sprint (`customfield_10007`), story points (`customfield_10004`)
- Post-creation steps: mandatory team assignment with parent inheritance logic
